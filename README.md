## Introduction
Welcome to __Wordle Clone DSA__. Wordle Clone DSA (WCDSA) is a React JS web clone of the mobile app game Wordle. WCDSA was developed from scratch until achieving the core functionalities of the mobile app game. WCDSA is playable in desktop and mobile. You can play with Wordle Clone DSA at [wordle-clone-dsa.netlify.app](https://wordle-clone-dsa.netlify.app/).

## Background

WCDSA utilizes matrices, a queue, and pointers to process individual user inputs in constant time (O(1)). These data structures also allow to more easiy implement the special features of specific-cell editing and adding placeholders (features that are usually missing in other web clones of Wordle).
