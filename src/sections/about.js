            <p>I created Wodle Clone with the goal of implementing Data Structures and Algorithms to real-world scenarios,
                and as a means of writing efficient code in practice. Wodle Clone utilizes a combination of a matrix and 
                queue data structures and a counter variable to access user input in constant time at any given 
                time during the game. This combination also allows to easily implement special features, such as
                specific-cell editing.
