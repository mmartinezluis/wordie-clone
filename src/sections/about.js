            <p>I created <strong>Wodle Clone</strong> with the goal of implementing <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> to real-world scenarios,
                and as a means of writing efficient code in practice. Wodle Clone utilizes a combination of a matrix and 
                queue data structures and a counter variable to access user input in constant time at any given 
                time during the game. This combination also allows to more easily implement special features, such as
                specific-cell editing.
            </p>
            <p>As simple as it may seem, Wodle Clone came with many interesting challenges that helped me 
                become a better problem solver and developer.
            </p>

            <p>Happy coding!!!</p>
